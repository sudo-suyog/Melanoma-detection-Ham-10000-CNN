In this project, I explored the use of AlexNet and InceptionV1 CNN architectures for automated melanoma detection, improving on manual diagnosis methods. Using the HAM10000 dataset, which includes seven classes of skin lesions with class imbalances, I applied feature extraction and data augmentation to boost performance. The analysis showed AlexNet excelled in accuracy and specificity, while InceptionV1 had better sensitivity. The moderate accuracy achieved in my general computational environment suggests potential for higher performance with larger, balanced datasets, demonstrating deep learningâ€™s promise in dermatology and Biomedical application.
